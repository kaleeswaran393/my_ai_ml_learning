Day 1
===============================
AI & DS 
  AI--> ML--> DL
AI--> Strong AI vs Weak AI

Data & Concept
   -->Humen can Analyze, identify the pattern andd make decision  --> Numeric Data--> ML & DP
   --> Humen can listen and Speak --> text/Audio--> ML and NLB
   --> Humen Can see & Recognize --> image/video--> Computer Vision and Deep Learning

Data Science DS --> Data Analytics, ML and DL 
DE - Data Engineer - DB, big data, ETL, Data pipeline
DS - AI/ML/DP
DA - Analyse historical data

Roles:
  ML Engineer
  Computer Vision Engineer
  NLP Engineer
  Data Scientist
  Business Intelligent Engineer

Application
   Object Recognition
   Face Recognition
   Autonomous vehicle
   Dsease Detection
   Emotion Recognition
   Agriculture
   Sentiment Analytics - NLP
   Language Translation - NLP
   Steganography and Cryptography
   satellite image analysis
   mobil camera

ML Basics
===================
DeepLearning using Numpy
Why TensorFlow/Theano not Numpy?
Why Keras not TensorFlow/Theano?

DL Libraries - Theano, Tensorflow, Torch, Keras, Caffe, CNTK, Lasagne . Expert prefer Keas bz it wrapper over tensor and theano

Convolution Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Feed Forward Neural Network etc
Machine Learning deals with lot of Linear Algebra operations like dot product, transpose, reshape etc.

sigmoid, Tanh, RELU etc
